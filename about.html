            <p class="text-align-justified">VEDA is a private production and design enterprise, established in Skopje, in 1991. It is a Research &
                Development
                oriented entity, which provides new, custom-made solutions in the field of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Solid fire extinguishing methods</li>
                <li>Production of biodiesel and energy from renewable sources</li>
                <li>Thermoplastic composite materials for different applications</li>
                <li>New materials for insulation with heat resistance of over 3000 C etc</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-align-justified">VEDA has a small diverse team of 7 full time employees, most of whom have been with the company since its
                beginnings. However, due to its commitment to excellence, innovation and state of art technology, VEDA
                cooperates with an external expert team consisted of experienced mechanical, chemical and electronic
                engineers,
                some with over 35 years of experience in their field of expertise.</p>

            <p class="text-align-justified">Since its beginning, VEDA’s vision was production of special processing equipment and products that would
                meet
                market demands in particular fields, but at the same time provide solution to some of the most current
                issues,
                such
                as environmental protection. This is why most of its innovative thinking is applied in solutions which
                take
                fully
                into account the environmental protection as an urgent matter in any scientific field.</p>

            <p class="text-align-justified">At the time of the company’s establishing, the Macedonian market was too narrow for VEDA’s ideas, which
                immediately
                turned VEDA towards the world market.Thus very soon, the VEDA’s expert team, based on prior knowledge in
                the
                field
                of composite materials and technological processes, successfully created own unique production program,
                which
                offered wide application possibilities of its final products. VEDA’s potential partners are now able to
                utilize
                its
                original technological lines for different applications, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For innovative solutions in fire extinguishing technology</li>
                <li>As a new wave of thermoplastic composite materials</li>
                <li>For advanced insulation solutions and new materials</li>
                <li>For energy production from renewable resources etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>The R&D facilities & capacity</h5>
            <p class="text-align-justified">The above mentioned was accomplished due to significant and continuous investment in own Research &
                Development
                facilities. VEDA’s equipment is designed, assembled and produced according to own documentation and
                utilizes a
                computerized system for management of the technological processes with a software also developed by the
                company
                itself. Furthermore, VEDA built its own R&D laboratory, technological line with a semi-industrial
                production
                capacity as well as specially designed equipment with high level of flexibility which enables quick
                adjustments
                of
                the future final products and possibility for fast changes in the parameters. This is why VEDA’s
                development
                process
                is characterized with efficiency and results, which can stand hand in hand with some of the most
                advances R&D
                centers around the world.
